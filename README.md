# Network_Intrusion_Detection_System
A **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** is a cybersecurity tool that monitors and analyzes network traffic in real-time to detect unauthorized access, malicious activities, or potential threats. 
It uses methods like signature-based detection, which matches traffic patterns to known attack signatures, and anomaly-based detection, which identifies deviations from normal behavior. 
By providing alerts and detailed reports, NIDS helps ensure early threat detection, enhances network visibility, and supports regulatory compliance.
While it operates without disrupting normal activities, challenges like false positives, handling encrypted traffic, and processing large data volumes require careful management.

The source code provides a comprehensive approach to building an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques. 
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of machine learning models.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing:
  Handles data imbalances and applies feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualizes key trends and patterns in the data to derive insights.

- Machine Learning Models:
  Trains and evaluates models designed to detect intrusions with high accuracy.

- Performance Metrics:
  Compares models using standard evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
This notebook requires several Python libraries commonly used in data science and machine learning. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed before running the notebook.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in your preferred Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the cells step by step, following the logical progression of the analysis.

## Notes
- The required dataset for the analysis should be placed in the appropriate directory. Update file paths in the notebook as needed.
- Hyperparameters and model configurations can be adjusted to improve performance based on specific requirements.

## Acknowledgements
This project leverages various open-source libraries and builds upon established methodologies in intrusion detection within the field of cybersecurity.
